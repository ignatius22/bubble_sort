# bubble_sort

This is the first project that welcomes us into the Ruby Section of the Microverse Remote Software Development Curriculum. It is the interesting topic because me and my partner made a bubble_sort function instead of using the predefined function.


# Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone the project:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ignatius22/bubble_sort.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd bubble_sort

```

## Tools and technology used

- Ruby
- irb


## Bubble-sort Algorithm

### Steps on how it works:

- In an unsorted array of 4 elements, start with the first two elements and sort them in ascending order. (Compare the element to check which one is greater).

- Compare the second and third element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Compare the third and fourth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Repeat steps 1‚Äì3 until no more swaps are required.
